# Astronity - Astro + Sanity.io Blog

This example shows how to connect [Sanity.io](https://sanity.io) with [Astro](https://astro.build).

For more information, check out [this article](https://maciekpalmowski.dev/playing-around-with-sanity-io).

## Installation
This repository consists of two parts:
- **Sanity.io** backend - it's in the `studio` folder
- **Astro** frontend

1. Run `npm install` in the main folder and the `studio` folder.
2. Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and fill it with Sanity.io `projectID` and `dataset`. Instead of the `.env` file, you can also use environmental variables.
3. Run `npm run dev` in both folders.
